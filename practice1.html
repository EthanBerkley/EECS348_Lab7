  <!-- Make a profile page that is styled with CSS. Have fun with this. In your profile, you need to
include your name, a photo, and contact info and showcase anything good for your professional
career, e.g., courses, projects, and work experience... You could also use JS and PHP in this
practice. At the same time, you must include at least one link and video. -->
